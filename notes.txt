bundling building tools 
    vite (esbuilds) helps larger projects save their code faster
        scales faster b/c dynamically loads modules rather than building all together like creat-react-app
        server side rendering here, a pro
        transitioning is painless from create-react-apps
    nextjs
        wildy growing popular and growing
        by vercel (some FB peeps left to go to vercel, concerning some developers on monopoly over react)
        react server components 
    probably not important, but pnpm is preferred


npm create vite@latest
    TypeScript + SWC-swc is faster
    npm run dev to do stuff

    main.tsx is entrypoint

    <script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script> receives components
